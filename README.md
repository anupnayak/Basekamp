What are we building? Basekamp
For lack of a better name, I titled the app of this series  Basekamp. The goal of the app is to be a home for any amount of projects(think Basecamp but much more stripped down). A project lives within a team and can have as many users as necessary. A user can only belong to one team at a time (this is a small side-effect of the Devise gem. Ultimately, we'd want to extend this to allow a single user to belong to multiple teams.)

The app will have 3 overlying models/relationships to tie together each other as we press forward but I'll outline the "wants" below:

A User can create a project if they belong to a team.
Creating a team assigns both your own account plus those you invite to a team.
Projects require a team in order to be created.


Things you may want to cover:

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
